#🌍 Wanderlust
Wanderlust is a modern, full-stack property rental web application (inspired by Airbnb) that lets users explore, review, and share unique stays across the globe.

This project served as a deep dive into connecting backend logic, database design, and a dynamic frontend UI into one seamless, production-ready application.
