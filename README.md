Wanderlust â€“ Airbnb Clone
I developed a full-stack web application that replicates core Airbnb functionalities. The project was built with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js, focusing on secure authentication, smooth CRUD operations, and cloud integrations for a production-like experience.

Key Highlights:

Implemented user authentication & authorization with session handling

Built CRUD functionalities for property listings

Integrated Cloudinary for image upload and management

Used MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database storage

Deployed the app on Render with GitHub integration for seamless deployment
